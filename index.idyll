We’ve all seen the suggestions: to stop climate change, become a vegetarian, ride a bike instead of driving a car, buy a carbon offset for air travel, have fewer children! Amid the endless barrage of ways that consumers can lower their carbon footprint, it might be tempting to assume that individual action is the most direct way to combat climate change. It goes without saying that individuals—especially the wealthiest 10% who disproportionately account for half of all individual emissions—can and should curb their personal carbon emissions. But this narrative of individual responsibility distracts from a different source of responsibility: the 20 fossil fuel corporations that have accounted for 30% of all carbon emissions since 1965. In an effort to find the most direct way to combat climate change, we have placed outsized importance on individuals and absolved the small number of corporations that have the highest emissions, the greatest ability to implement large-scale changes, and the most leverage over the future of the planet’s energy policies.

Since 1965 carbon emissions have risen from X to XXX. These emissions are the single largest contributor to a global temperature rise of 1 degree since the pre-industrial period which has caused major loss of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice, untold damage to natural ecosystems, drastic weather extremes, and increased global human inequality and loss of life.

The way that we aggregate data shapes  the meaning we take away and the space of resulting actions we consider. Do we break out emissions by continent, country, trade bloc, industry, service, or corporation?  Do we attribute emissions of products to the producers or the consumers? Multiple interpretations are possible since emissions come from a system with many moving parts. Corporate emissions overlap with country-specific emissions, just as they often include downstream emissions from individual consumers of products or goods sold by the company.

 Richard Heede and the [Climate Accountability Institute (CAI)](https://climateaccountability.org/carbonmajors.html) have assembled data attributing greenhouse gas emissions to specific fossil fuel producers, which provides a new perspective on the causes of, and solutions to, climate change.

 In Heede's own words: "Even though global consumers from individuals to corporations are the ultimate emitters of carbon dioxide, the Climate Accountability Institute focuses its work on the fossil fuel companies that, in our view, have their collective hand on the throttle and the tiller determining the rate of carbon emissions and the shift to non-carbon fuels."

 Let's explore the data:

   [Step]
     ## Producer emissions

     To get acquainted with the data, let's start by looking at the emissions data for Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's main oil production company.

     The emissions numbers in the CAI dataset include both direct emissions from the process of fossil fuel extraction, and downstream emissions from burning the fuels sold by the company. Generally, about 90% of emissions associated with a producer come from downstream usage.

     The y-axis here is measured in MtCO2e, megatons of [carbon dioxide equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent). For reference, global CO2 emissions in 2017 were estimated at about 37,000 MtCO2e; in recent years the products from this single company have contributed about 5% of all global emissions.
   [/Step]

   [Step]
     ## Top 20 entities

     Next, let's expand our view to the top 20 companies, ranked by emissions from 1965-2017. Together, these 20 entities account for 35% of global emissions since 1965, reflecting an extraordinary concentration of emissions in a small number of companies.

     Production dipped in the 1980s due to [a drop in demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_oil_glut) after the 1970s oil crisis, but otherwise has been steadily increasing.

     Hover over any producer to see more information.

   [Step]
     ## State vs investor ownership

     When thinking about levers for fighting climate change, it's useful to consider ownership: are these companies [span style:`{color:'#fb8072', 'fontWeight': 'bold'}`]state-owned[/span], or [span style:`{color:'#80b1d3', 'fontWeight': 'bold'}`]investor-owned[/span]?

     The data shows that many of the largest emitters are state-owned, but investor-owned companies with publicly traded stocks have played a major role too, comprising seven of the top 20.
   [/Step]

   [Step]
     ## Investor-owned companies

     Investor-owned companies provide a unique lever for addressing climate change.

     All 7 of these companies have a history of [spreading public doubt](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/climate-deception-dossiers-0) about climate science and spending [millions of dollars on lobbying](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/22/top-oil-firms-spending-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-says-report) to block climate change policies.

     However, they are also accountable to their shareholders. Private investors can directly pressure these companies to support progressive climate policies and invest in renewable energy going forward, providing another avenue for addressing climate change besides encouraging government action.

     ## Campaigns of deception

     Todo, no chart for this yet—idea is to overlay deception campaigns
     onto this timeline

## Meta

This is a very rough draft. The goal of this prototype was:

* do enough preprocessing on the CAI data to get it into a usable format for this piece
* sketch out the backbone of some of the core visualizations

Some design goals to call out, based on previous conversation:

* stacked area chart emphasizes cumulative growth in emissions
* start with one company's data, explain clearly before zooming out
* use animation to explain the relationship between graphs
* use hover on chart to let people explore a bit more about each company

Incomplete list of things that need more work:

* The text copy needs a total rewrite, it's more just there as notes to anchor the visulizations and get the skeleton in place.
* Want to add more information about deception campaigns led by investor-owned
* Is continuous scrollytelling (without scrolljacking) irritating because you have to figure out how to scroll to the right spot? Maybe better to split into discrete steps with a way to click nextt?
* Not sure about the use of color in the charts.
* The layout sizing is pretty hardcoded, needs a lot of love to be more responsive. Can we do something better with the graphs + text? (maybe find a way to overlay text over graphs?) Also there's some CSS wonkiness with the relationship between the scroll graphic and text.
* The d3 component for the graphs needs a serious code review + cleanup, I plan to do a first pass there. Some of the messiness comes from coordinating the multiple scroller steps with the graphs, wonder if there are best practices for that
* generally improve visual design of the charts, make it fit better with the parametric style and make it snazzier
